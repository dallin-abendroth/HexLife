# HexLife

## Conway's Game of Life with Hexagons

The same rules as [Conway's Game of Life](https://playgameoflife.com/)

1. Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
2. Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
3. Each cell with two neighbors survives.
4. Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.

Just seemed like a fun project.
